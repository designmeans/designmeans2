    <p>I went to college in the East Village. Well, technically the main school building was just on the west side of Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. But while I was busy soaking up the nerdy technical side of graphic design by day, what stands out for me from that time is the education I received on the dark streets of the East Village.</p> 
	<p>Not to say school was a breeze. I didn't have every night to explore what surrounded Tomkins Square Park in those days. Design training was a wonky workload of memorizing scores of fonts, getting to know the technical aspects of image editing and layout programs, discovering the potentials and limitations of various printing and production methods, and absorbing decades of graphic design history—starting with Gutenberg's printing press, and the illuminated manuscripts of monks before that.</p>
	<p>But on nights I could afford to put homework aside and venture out—sometimes with newfound friends, but mostly alone with hands shoved deep in my pockets—my eyes were opened to another world I hadn't known before, growing up back in Texas.</p>
	<p>The East Village back in the early 2000s—before Bloomberg and the blackout of 2003 and September 11th—was still a no man's land. Far from any subway, no condos or high-rises overtaking the old walkups and warehouses. No boutiques, fro-yo spots, or nail salons. There weren't even that many people on the streets after dark. Restaurants and bars didn't announce themselves too blatantly. No doors slung open with crowds and music spilling out onto brightly lit sidewalk tables. You stepped in through a darkened doorway, led there by someone who knew the place, before iPhones and Yelp and Google Maps, before Bluetooth headsets and even—I can't believe—texting.</p>
	<p>On my own on those streets, I spent nights out haunting entrances to the handful of gay bars in walking distance of the dorm. Walking slowly past, eyes peeled, then circling back and passing by again, studying the men out front smoking together, or the guys waiting to have their IDs checked to get in. I wasn't old enough to enter. And even if I was, I didn't have the nerve yet to venture in alone, to go after what I really wanted. To move towards that flame.</p>
	<p>Later—second semester, maybe—I'd made a handful of gay friends. A few of them were familiar enough with the bouncers at a couple of the bars on certain nights that they could wave me through with a nonchalant, "He's cool, he's with me." And on the other side of those doors, on those nights, trying to still my shaky hands and cover up my extreme unease, I would follow them up to the bar and then sip my beer up against the wall or a column, surveying the scene, thinking finally I'm here. Among my tribe.</p>
	<p>Now, if only I could work up the courage to actually open my mouth to speak to anyone. Break into a game of pool, maybe. But I wasn't there yet.</p>
	<p>Soon, though—my first summer in New York, if I remember right—the bar nights became a regular thing. One spot called the Wonderbar we nicknamed "The Church," because we were there religiously, on the nights with the best crowds and our favorite DJs. "You going to church tonight?" was a common elevator question among my new friends in the dorm during summer session. Our usual circuit was Wonderbar, then Starlight Lounge, then the Phoenix, and then if we were feeling bold, a notorious hook-up bar called The Cock, just four blocks down from the dorm's front entrance.</p>
	<p>By that point, I wasn't the scared cowering freshman anymore. I knew the streets of the East Village like the back of my hand. Could get from one gay bar to the next, no matter how drunk I was at any point in the night. Could lead a man back to the dorm or hail a cab on Avenue A back to his place, both of us stumbling into each other with wide smiles, like it was my own neighborhood all along. Which it really felt like, by then.</p>
	<p>Sophomore year I moved out of the East Village to a new dorm, new digs, and a new seriousness about my studies. And by that point, I was no longer limited by an uneasiness with the big city. I went out all over town—Chelsea, Christopher Street, Hell's Kitchen, Brooklyn. All of New York was mine, no longer timidly wandering in a strict five-block radius, scared to venture any further. The East Village always felt like my New York City home, though. Anytime I found myself back in those first few bars, a nostalgia hit me as I scanned the room, nodding to familiar bartenders, striking up a conversation over a game of pool with old regulars.</p>
	<p>But mostly, by the time I approached graduation, the neighborhood felt changed. Not what I once knew. Starlight had since closed. The original location of The Cock was shuttered and moved to a new spot closer to Houston Street, where it became more tame and unexciting. The Wonderbar, too, was renamed and refashioned into something called Eastern Bloc. And life on the street had been scrubbed squeaky clean and gone upmarket—all in all not my East Village anymore.</p>
	<p>***</p>
	<p>Fastforward twelve years, I'm living in Brooklyn and working in Midtown. I take the L train underneath the East Village every day, but rarely feel its pull anymore, having found new haunts and other friends, closer to work and home.</p>
	<p>Then, one recent horrible Monday night and into Tuesday morning, a hurricane turned the city on its head, upending lives with torrents of water and plunging whole neighborhoods into darkness. One of those neighborhoods was the East Village.</p>
	<p>I was cut off from Manhattan, no trains from my section of Brooklyn into the city, the boroughs once more islands unto themselves. For the first day after the storm I hunkered down like every other New Yorker, sticking close to home and waiting for my city to come back online. But before the city's systems were functioning again, because of my job on a newspaper, I had to get to Manhattan somehow, public transportation or no. So I started biking the seven miles every day, over the steep bridge and back, through the cold, to get the paper out even as the rest of the city still lay in critical condition.</p>
	<p>Biking through the streets of Manhattan with no traffic lights and no streetlights—no lights at all, other than the headlights glaring through the dark as if on a deserted country road—felt like a suicide run. Especially on the way home at night, through the dark. It was amazing how, over the Williamsburg Bridge, I pedaled up into the dark sky as the bridge climbed, the uneven path a mystery beneath my wheels until the apex of the bridge, when the lights of the bikepath resumed out over the water, and for the rest of the ride downhill into Brooklyn, the lamps were lit and the city was all of the sudden normal again.</p>
	<p>The most poignant journey for me by bike in that strange time was the night I left work after power was restored to certain patches of lower Manhattan on the following Friday evening. Midtown to 26th Street, everything fine. Twenty-sixth to Fourteenth, back in darkness. And then below Fourteenth Street, neighborhoods were just starting to come back to life, with power restored. Residents ventured out of their candlelit flats. A few businesses warily rolled up their gates. And the feeling on the streets for me was a trip back in time, to the East Village I remembered from over a decade ago, when I first arrived to Manhattan.</p>
	<p>I biked more slowly that night, savoring the scene. There were no tourists, no double-decker sightseeing busses trolling the streets. No bridge-and-tunnel crowd from New Jersey or Long Island or wherever, drunkenly screaming in stilettos on every street, stumbling from bar to bar for a bachelorette party, or yelling at their friends to meet them at Seventh and Avenue A for a slice of pizza before all-night karaoke.</p> 
	<p>The more commercial restaurants and the upscale bars were slower to come back online than the local joints that had somehow survived the steep uptick in rent and neighborhood status. The tapas joints, fancy wine bars, chain stores, and bubble-tea lounges, and any place that took reservations, were not back to life just yet. For just one night, this was the East Village from my memory.</p>
	<p>I was tempted to dismount my bike and stop into one of my old haunts, for old time's sake. But I was all alone that night, and pedaling slowly through the reawakening streets felt like enough. Reabsorbing the unusual quiet I recalled from before, and appreciating the rare glimpse of a remembered scene, in that moment weirdly brought back into being. My personal time-machine ride. Grinning, as I pedaled by, at who I was back then—a nerdy still-semi-closeted eighteen-year-old design student, fresh off the plane.</p>
	<p>I doubled back before reaching Delancey, up Avenue A and around Tomkins Square Park one last lost time, wanting to soak it up just a bit more, before starting the climb of the bridge.</p>
